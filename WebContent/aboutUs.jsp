Smatch &#40;Student Match&#41; was founded in January 2014 at the University of North Carolina Charlotte in a software development 
class by Carla Bendezu, Moncef El Ouriaghli, Blanche White, and Abigail Scott. The assignment was for everyone to group up 
with 4 to 5 people and create software, anything we wanted &#40;within reason&#41; that is if we could create it. So we began to 
think, what is something that we really needed these days&#63; How could we contribute to learning institutions long term&#63; We 
thought about our group&#39;s functioning, observed other groups and said &#34;that&#39;s it&#33;&#34; What if we created software that could 
help educators create well&#45;balanced groups&#63; Everyone has had that group where there is that person or people that slack and 
at the last minute a couple of members end up doing all of the work, or that group where at least two people can&#39;t get along 
and it&#39;s hard to make a unanimous decision.

With the drilling need for students to improve team working and leadership skills, Learning Institutions are encouraging more 
group collaborative assignments. We created Smatch to fulfill that need by not only allowing educators to create groups based 
on an educator&#39;s preference but by also implementing Smatch with Group management features for both the educator and the 
student. This allows students to learn to efficiently contribute to group work.
